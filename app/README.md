# Starwars Project
Application that use the data of url: 'swapi.dev' and manipulate and organize it to a table with Flask, Pandas and Docker.

I first request the data in the url above, manipulate the url with Pandas, transform the json it to a dictionary type.
that is more easy to manipulate to create a table.After that and complete the logical part, I commit this project on GitHub.
With this, I get the code and other files of my project for git and transform it a DockerFile, better, 
I clone de project and create a DockerFile with that.
